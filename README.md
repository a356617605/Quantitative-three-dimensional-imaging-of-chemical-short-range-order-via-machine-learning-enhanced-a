# FeAl-short-range-order

Chemical short-range order (CSRO) refers to the formation of preferential atomic neighbourhoods leading to the local ordering of elements within a disordered matrix. Despite its impact on the mechanical and functional properties of nominally single-phase solid solutions and subsequent on clustering/ordering/precipitation phenomena1-6, many aspects of CSRO remain elusive. Although inherently a three-dimensional (3D) phenomenon, CSRO is typically only imaged in 2D (two-dimensional) space by e.g. electron microscopy, which hinders a quantitative assessment of CSRO in relation with the materials compositions, processing and properties, and hence its use as a materials design parameter to tailor materials. Here, we present a machine learning enhanced strategy to overcome the inherent resolution limitation of atom probe tomography (APT) and map CSRO in 3D space in body-centred-cubic (BCC) Fe-18at.% Al solid solution alloys. By applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on synthetic CSRO patterns, we observe the co-existence of two types of CSROs, and quantitatively extract size and morphology distributions. Finally, this approach enable to unveil the quantitative relationship between different annealing temperatures, degrees of two types of CSROs, and variations of nano hardness and electrical resistance in this BCC system. The proposed methodology paves a way for quantitatively investigating various challenging CSRO or cluster phenomena in metallic materials, which enables to bridge their composition/processing/microstructure/property relationships.
