# Quantitative three-dimensional imaging of chemical short-range order via machine learning enhanced atom probe tomography

Chemical short-range order (CSRO) refers to the formation of preferential atomic neighbourhoods leading to specific elements self-organising within a disordered matrix. Despite its potential impact on the mechanical and functional properties of nominally single-phase solid solutions and on subsequent clustering/ordering/precipitation phenomena, many aspects of CSRO remain elusive. Although inherently a three-dimensional phenomenon, CSRO can typically only be imaged through two-dimensional projections by e.g. electron microscopy. This hinders the quantitative assessment of CSRO with the composition and processing, and hence its use as a design parameter to tailor materialsâ€™ properties. Here, we present a machine-learning-enhanced approach to overcome the inherent resolution limitation of atom probe tomography and map CSRO in a body-centred-cubic Fe-18Al (at.%) solid solution alloy, in three dimensions and at the near-atomic scale. We reveal the co-existence of two types of CSROs and accurately extract their morphology and size distributions, finally allowing for a quantitative correlation between the annealing temperature and the degree of CSRO, in relation to the nano-hardness and electrical resistivity. The proposed methodology paves the way for quantitatively investigating CSRO in a vast array of metallic materials.
